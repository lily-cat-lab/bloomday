    <h1>New England Seminar on Bloom Filters</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the first annual New England Seminar on Bloom filters
        (NES-Bloom). The
        seminar will be held remotely via Zoom. The intent of NES-Bloom is to bring together researchers and
        practitioners across cs theory, algorithms, cryptography, and systems for talks and discussions.
        NES-Bloom will be held weekly, on Wednesday evenings, from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM Eastern Time.
    </p>

    <h2>Attending the seminar</h2>
    <p>The seminar is open to all, including faculty and students from any educational institution, industry-based
        experts, and anyone interested in the field. The seminar is free to attend, no registration is required.
    </p>

    <p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesdays, 5:00-6:00 PM Eastern Time<br>
        <strong>Where:</strong> Remote (Zoom)<br>

    <h2>Scope of the seminar</h2>
    <p>NES-Bloom welcomes talks on all aspects of probabilistic data structures, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bloom filters and all its variants, including cuckoo filters, bloomier filters, and others</li>
        <li>Count-Min Sketch, and other sketch-based data structures</li>
        <li>Learning-augmented data structures such as the learned Bloom filter and others</li>
        <li>Adversarial models and robustness related to data structures and streaming algorithms</li>
        <li>Systems and applications using probabilistic data structures, including distributed systems, cloud
            computing, and others</li>
        <li>Theoretical models and proofs, including the use of probabilistic data structures in theoretical
            models</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
    <p>To present your work at NES-Bloom, please submit a talk proposal by the end of the week before the seminar. You
        can send the proposal
        to either the owners of the Google Group or the Discord admins. We encourage including the following in the
        proposal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name and affiliation (can be unaffiliated), and short bio</li>
        <li>Talk title, abstract, and duration (Short is 30 minutes including Q&A, Long is 1 hour including Q&A)</li>
        <li>Optional links to papers, preprints, videos, or code</li>
        <li>Which week you would like to present your talk (the week before the seminar)</li>
    </ul>
