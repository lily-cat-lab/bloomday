    <h1>New England Probability and Computing Seminar</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the first annual New England Probability and Computing Seminar
        (NES-PC). We will be scheduling talks on a rolling basis throughout Fall 2025. The
        seminar will be held remotely via Zoom (link will be posted on the mailing list and Discord). The intent of
        NES-PC is to bring together researchers and
        practitioners across cs theory, algorithms, cryptography, and systems for talks and discussions.
    </p>

    <h2>Attending the seminar</h2>
    <p>Open to all, including faculty and students from any educational institution. No registration is required.</p>

    <p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesdays, 5:00-6:00 PM Eastern Time<br>
        <strong>Where:</strong> Remote (Zoom)<br>

    <p>Join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/nes-pc">google group</a> to get updates on the seminar.</p>
    </p>

    <h2>Scope of the seminar</h2>
    <p>NES-PC welcomes talks on all aspects of probability and computing, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Probabilistic data structures including Bloom filters, cuckoo filters, and others</li>
        <li>Randomized algorithms and streaming algorithms</li>
        <li>Applications of probability including cryptography, machine learning, differential privacy, and others</li>
        <li>Performance modeling and analysis of systems using probability tools</li>
        <li>Anything else that generally fits the theme of probability and computing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
    <p>To present your work at NES-PC, please submit a talk proposal by the end of the week before the seminar. You
        can send the proposal to <a href="mailto:nesbloom.organizers@gmail.com">nesbloom.organizers@gmail.com</a>. The
        proposal should include your name, affiliation, short bio, talk title, and abstract. Talks are typically 1 hour,
        including Q & A. Optional links to papers, preprints, videos, or code are encouraged. We will schedule talks
        on a rolling basis throughout Fall 2025.</p>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p>The schedule will be updated as speakers confirm their presentations.</p>
