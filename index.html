    <h1>New England Seminar on Bloom Filters</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the first annual New England Seminar on Bloom filters
        (NES-Bloom). We will be scheduling talks on a rolling basis throughout Fall 2025. The
        seminar will be held remotely via Zoom (link will be posted on the mailing list and Discord). The intent of
        NES-Bloom is to bring together researchers and
        practitioners across cs theory, algorithms, cryptography, and systems for talks and discussions.
    </p>

    <h2>Attending the seminar</h2>
    <p>Open to all, including faculty and students from any educational institution. No registration is required.</p>

    <p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesdays, 5:00-6:00 PM Eastern Time<br>
        <strong>Where:</strong> Remote (Zoom)<br>
        <strong>Mailing list:</strong> <a
            href="https://groups.google.com/g/nes-bloom">https://groups.google.com/g/nes-bloom</a><br>
    </p>

    <h2>Scope of the seminar</h2>
    <p>NES-Bloom welcomes talks on all aspects of probabilistic data structures, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bloom filters and all its variants, including cuckoo filters, bloomier filters, and others</li>
        <li>Count-Min Sketch, and other sketch-based data structures</li>
        <li>Learning-augmented data structures such as the learned Bloom filter and others</li>
        <li>Adversarial models and robustness related to data structures and streaming algorithms</li>
        <li>Systems and applications using probabilistic data structures, including distributed systems, cloud
            computing, and others</li>
        <li>Theoretical models and proofs, including the use of probabilistic data structures in theoretical
            models</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
    <p>To present your work at NES-Bloom, please submit a talk proposal by the end of the week before the seminar. You
        can send the proposal to <a href="mailto:nesbloom.organizers@gmail.com">nesbloom.organizers@gmail.com</a>. The
        proposal should include your name, affiliation, short bio, talk title, abstract, and duration (Short is 30
        minutes including Q&A, Long is 1 hour including Q&A). Optional links to papers, preprints, videos, or code.</p>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p>The schedule will be updated as speakers confirm their presentations.</p>
